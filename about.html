          in Bergen. Three years after the first storage was opened and the growth of the company we started to plan our
          first store outside of Norway. The thrid store was opened in Sweden in 1993.</p>

        <p>Within the coming two years of growth in both Norway and Sweden, Rainydays were able to start to planing for
          over twenty more stores in both Norway and Sweden. The plan was to have all of this stores in place within
          1999.</p>
        <p>The success of Rainydays concept was overwhelmed for the company and in 2005 we was ready for the next step
          for the company. Our plan was to be able to delivery our market and clothes for the hole world and become an

          and changes over the years but Rainydays absolute comforted with the competition in the market and the biggest
